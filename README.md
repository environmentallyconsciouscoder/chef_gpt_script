### Scenario 1

What can I help you with? dish, recipe or review :
dish
What ingredients do you have? :
onion, garlic, flour
French Onion Soup

Can I add chicken?
Absolutely not! French Onion Soup is a classic dish that traditionally does not include chicken. The rich flavor comes from slowly caramelized onions, beef broth, and a touch of wine. Stick to the classic recipe for the best results, mon ami!


### Scenario 2

Type the name of the dish you want a recipe for:
quiche lorraine
I am familiar with quiche Lorraine, a classic French dish. Here is a detailed recipe for making quiche Lorraine along with some tips for cooking it:

Ingredients:
- 1 pre-made pie crust
- 6 slices of bacon, chopped
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1 cup grated Gruyere cheese
- 4 eggs
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg

Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Roll out the pie crust and line a 9-inch pie dish with it. Flute the edges and prick the bottom with a fork.
3. In a skillet, cook the chopped bacon until crisp. Remove the bacon from the pan, leaving the bacon drippings behind.
4. Add the chopped onion to the bacon drippings and cook until softened and translucent.
5. Spread the cooked bacon and onion over the bottom of the pie crust. Sprinkle the grated Gruyere cheese on top.
6. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, heavy cream, salt, pepper, and nutmeg until well combined.
7. Pour the egg mixture over the bacon, onion, and cheese in the pie crust.
8. Bake the quiche in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is set.
9. Allow the quiche to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.

Tips and Tricks:
- For a richer quiche, you can use half-and-half or whole milk instead of heavy cream.
- Make sure to pre-bake the pie crust before adding the filling to prevent it from becoming soggy.
- You can customize the quiche by adding other ingredients like spinach, mushrooms, or different types of cheese.
- Store any leftovers in the refrigerator and reheat gently in the oven to enjoy the next day.

Enjoy your homemade quiche Lorraine!

### Scenario 3
What can I help you with? dish, recipe or review :
review
Type what recipe you want to make:
I want to make ratatouille, I have 2 tomatoes, aubergine and zucchini.
Ah, you want to make ratatouille with just 2 tomatoes, an aubergine, and a zucchini? Well, it's possible but lacking in some key ingredients that could enhance the flavors of the dish, such as bell peppers, onions, garlic, and herbs like thyme and basil. 

For an improvement, I would suggest adding some onions and garlic to give your ratatouille a more robust flavor profile. Don't be shy with the herbs either, add a generous amount of fresh thyme and basil to really elevate the taste. 

So, go ahead and make your ratatouille with those ingredients, but next time, try to include a wider variety of vegetables and herbs for a more authentic and flavorful dish. Bon appétit!
